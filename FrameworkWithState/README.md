# Framework with State Management

The Framework version of Ugly Metronome is a simple React application, so it's appropriate to pass state to components via props. What happens when the application gets bigger and the state more complicated? Passing state via props gets confusing and hard to manage. While overkill for the Ugly Metronome, this version includes the kind of state management needed to keep things straight in a more complicated application.

- Adds a global state management solution
- Simplifies arguments passed to components
