# Ugly Metronome

Ugly Metronome is a project exploring the modern JavaScript ecosystem. This simple, visual metronome is implemented in a number of ways in order to explore the advantages and drawbacks of modern front-end development.

- HTML/JavaScript (coming soon) - The most basic, three file implementation.
- Modern Tooling - Still no framework, but uses Tailwind and a modern build pipeline.
- Framework (coming soon) - The same Ugly Metronome, but this time in React!
