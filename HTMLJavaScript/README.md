# HTML/JavaScript

I lied, this implementation is four files because we still need the sound file. The HTML is very clean, all the logic is in a single JavaScript file and the `style.css` file is small enough to remain easy to parse at a glance.

I had three goals in mind when writing this version of Ugly Metronome:

- Show a visual metronome that could flash sixteenth notes
- No dependencies or outside code
- Only do the work that is required for the core functionality
